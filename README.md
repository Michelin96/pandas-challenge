PyCitySchools requested that their raw school and student data files be analyzed for trends in academic averages and school spending. This Jupyter Notebook file has several tables that show summary data for the entire district, per school, and per groups by type and budget.

Here are a few trends that developed from the analysis.

The group with the lowest spending per student has the hightest average scores and passing rates. This implies that spending more per student does not improve overall scores.

The smaller schools have the highest average scores in math and reading. Smaller school sizes most likely have smaller class sizes, reducing the student-teacher ratio. This invariably provides more time for indiviual help.

The Charter School group has an overall passing rate over 20% higher than the District School group. It would seem that the environment of Charter schools is more condusive to learning.
